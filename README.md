This was my project which I made with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Well, I didn't focused on the UI but achieving this functionality at that time was a biggest achievement for me. 
I completed this project with the help of Google and Stackoverflow but in the end, I learned alot from this project. 

Remember, starting from these simple projects can make you a great developer afterwards in your long term journey.
